![Status logged to console](./readme_images/gmg_status.png)

This is a javascript application designed to connect to your GMG and record it's status to a database so informative charts can be generated and cooks can be saved for learning purposes (ex: how long did my last 12lb brisket cook take and when was the stall complete?)

> This project is still work in progress (WIP) and while it's stable enough that I use it every time I run my GMG, there are still some limitations and bugs that need to be resolved.

> Remember you are controlling an appliance that makes heat and fire ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ - be safe!

> NOTE on setting pizza mode - this commands adjusts your settings, its reccomended to make sure you settings are correct after sending this command by using the GMG app.

# Dev getting started

## Dependencies 

- CouchDB, I recommend installing using homebrew: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/couchdb. CouchDB was chosen because it's enterprise grade, real-time (via changes feed), can be run on a raspberry pi, and the browser/ webapp can connect directly to it.
- Node 12 (and npm) - can be installed from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or using `nvm`

## React UI

- Currently hosted as a separate project (maybe combine with Lerna in future). Checkout and get running by visiting: https://github.com/facultymatt/gmg-webapp

## Configure

- Find your grill IP. This can be done by looking at your network / router connected devices interface (google wifi has a great interface for this). The grill is called something like "unnamed devide".
- Open `config.js` and enter your Grill IP. 
- Enter a database name. Currently the way to save different cooks is the manually change this value. 

## Run and confirm it's working

- start CouchDB in a separate command window - `couchdb`
- install project dependencies `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- confirm you see a grill status printed to console. IF YOU HAVE THE CORRECT IP you will see status. If no status displays, check your IP and try again.
- open the webapp project directory and get that running. 

## Database UI

- You can visit http://localhost:5984/_utils/#/_all_dbs for a slick CouchDB UI.

## Running on Raspberry Pi

There is a simple script to facilitate dev / testing on raspberry pi. On each startup / reboot the following steps are prefermed. This makes it easy to run the latest by just power cycling the Pi.

1. pull latest source code from current branch (stay on master)
2. run `yarn` to get latest dependencies 
3. run `yarn start` to start in dev mode. (Eventually there will a way to run a built or dist version.)

### How to setup backend

- `sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/backend.service` 
- paste in contents from `backend.service`
- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- test starting with `sudo systemctl start backend.service`
- test stopping with `sudo systemctl stop backend.service`
- enable at startup `sudo systemctl enable backend.service`
- test it out with a reboot `sudo reboot`

### How to setup couchdb

- `sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/couchdb.service` 
- paste in contents from `couchdb.service`
- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- test starting with `sudo systemctl start couchdb.service`
- test stopping with `sudo systemctl stop couchdb.service`
- enable at startup `sudo systemctl enable couchdb.service`
- test it out with a reboot `sudo reboot`
